    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a story about the song Hurricane Katrina by Nadeah. The bottom line is that I love the song, but I didn&#8217;t buy the song and I&#8217;m not proud of it.</p>

<p>First I heard the song on <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/roots/playlist/default.htm">Triple J</a> How did I learn about such an awesome Australian radio station? That&#8217;s another story goes back to <a href="http://railscamps.com/">Rails Camp</a> @ <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/NoYP">Springbrook</a> and a nice gentlemen who goes by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/MarkRatjens">@MarkRatjens</a> on Twitter =)</p>

<p>The song instantly got to me. My first reaction was to go on youtube trying to search for it. There was a couple live versions. I was of course dissatisfied. So next up vimeo.com yet no studio version. But the silver lining is that I found another cute and apparently more famous song of Nadeah&#8217;s : Odile</p>

<p>So after playing Odile for a couple times I decided the album &#8220;Venus Gets Even&#8221; which both songs are from is what I want.</p>

<p>ME WANTZ:

<p>So being a responsible good citizen as I am, I went to iTunes Store. Searched and got: <em>Your search had no results.</em> Hmmm fine. Googled and got to Nadeah&#8217;s official site. Sweet, I can &#8216;buy online&#8217; or &#8216;by on iTunes&#8217;. Let&#8217;s try iTunes again, since it would not require shipping of any sort. There I was, iTunes Store France&#8230; Never mind, I still know where the buy button is. So I clicked and got: <em>This Apple ID is only valid for purchases in the U.S. iTunes Store. You will be switched to that Store. Try your purchase again.</em> And redirected to iTunes Store home page I was. Back to square one. Fine I&#8217;ll have it shipped. So I filled in my shipping details, was redirected to paypal, logged in and bam! something like <em>The merchant does not ship to your country.</em> And redirected I was back on Nadeah&#8217;s homepage. Why does nobody want to take my money?!</p>

<p><img src="http://weilu.github.com/images/post/2012-07-02-rage-face.png" title="[rageface]" ></p>

<p>That&#8217;s it, torrent time. There we go: 0 seed and 0 leech. You know how it works - the more you can&#8217;t have it, the more you desire it. So the only decent version I have is from streaming from Triple J. If only I could record it&#8230;</p>

<p>Googling mac audio recorder gives me <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">Audacity</a>. Following the <a href="http://manual.audacityteam.org/help/manual/man/tutorial_recording_computer_playback_on_mac.html">tutorial</a> I had my audio output redirect to <a href="http://cycling74.com/soundflower-landing-page/">soundflower</a> and simply by playing the time range of the streaming on Triple J the song was recorded. With a bit of cleaning up like some cropping and fading out the last bit. Here is what I got:</p>

<p><audio controls="controls">
  <source src="http://weilu.github.com/media/Hurricane_Katrina.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />
  Awww too bad your browser does not support the audio tag.
</audio></p>

<p>Enjoy. I guess that&#8217;s what they call a guilty pleasure.</p>

<p>*disclaimer: I do not own the song. The song is not for distribute. Only for sharing because it is beautiful.</p>

<p>Gone are the days when you thought you&#8217;ve sent out an important piece of document to someone and only discovered an hour later that you forgot to attache the file. *facepalm* Now gmail searches for word like &#8220;is attached&#8221; in your email content, and alerts you when you hit the send button if there&#8217;s no attachment to the email. That&#8217;s a nice little big detail there. Thanks gmail =)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It started with this talk by Joshua Foer on how one can use techniques like <em>the memory palace</em> to cultivate his/her memory to prepare speeches, remember random numbers and in his case, won a memory competition. I like his final remark about how the convenience provided by technology trained us to be too lazy to remember. But life is short and we are the sum of our memories. We need to be the kind of person who remembers to remember.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a great talk. Having a cultivated memory is not only important but also pretty handy. As sad and visually unpleasant the original memory palace story is, the technique actually sounded pretty fun. So I was reading about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transit_of_Venus," title="transit of Venus">transit of Venus</a>. Here is a little application:</p>

<blockquote><p>In forever 21, a 5-year-old boy is holding a full mark paper(100/100), while his young beautiful mother (who&#8217;s wearing a pair of very big glasses) reluctantly walks away from a big big round mirror to the fitting room.</p></blockquote>

<p>That translate to:</p>

<blockquote><p>Transits of Venus occur in a pattern that repeats every 243 years, with pairs of transits eight years apart separated by long gaps of 121.5 years and 105.5 years.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So here I am, admitting my failures. I guess this is when things will be taking a turn. My biggest problem: being treating myself way way way too seriously. That complicates things, and worst of all, makes myself feel hurt and sad. It&#8217;s not that I didn&#8217;t know one shouldn&#8217;t treat oneself too seriously. I learnt that while I was in the bay area 2 years ago. I remember how I was mocking those who were serious when I just came back to Singapore. I just forgot. I guess I underestimated the power of peer pressure. Anyways, I&#8217;m sooooo glad that this crucial motto is rediscovered, thanks to Jitterbug Perfume, thanks to Tom Robbins the author.</p>

<p><img src="/images/post/2012-07-21-jitterbug-perfume.jpg" title="Jitterbug Perfume" alt="Jitterbug Perfume" /></p>

<p>I finished the book this morning. It was no doubt an amazing book, easily my top 3 together with <em>About a Boy</em> and <em>the Help</em>. (Given I haven&#8217;t read that many books whatsoever) I was sad and all and couldn&#8217;t sleep last night until 3am. So after I finished the Jitterbug Perfume this morning and threw my laundry in the washing machine, I made my way to my favorite Starbucks in the neighborhood and start reading <em>The Well-Grounded Rubyist</em>. Somehow a quote from the <em>Jitterbug Perfume</em> keeps on bugging me. Something about bad habits. So I pull out my phone and looked it up. I ended up with not just the quote I was looking for, but also many more amazingly witty quotes from Tom Robbins. Here:</p>

<blockquote><p>“People used to die from germs. Now they died from bad habits. That was what Dr. Dannyboy said. Heart disease was caused by bad personal habits, cancer was caused by bad industrial habits, war was caused by bad political habits. Dannyboy believed that even old age was a habit. And habits could be broken.” ― Tom Robbins, Jitterbug Perfume</p>

<p>“People tend the take everything too seriously. Especially themselves. Yep. And that&#8217;s probably what makes &#8216;em scared and hurt so much of the time. Life is too serious to take that seriously.” ― Tom Robbins</p>

<p>“When we&#8217;re incomplete, we&#8217;re always searching for somebody to complete us. When, after a few years or a few months of a relationship, we find that we&#8217;re still unfulfilled, we blame our partners and take up with somebody more promising. This can go on and on&#8211;series polygamy&#8211;until we admit that while a partner can add sweet dimensions to our lives, we, each of us, are responsible for our own fulfillment. Nobody else can provide it for us, and to believe otherwise is to delude ourselves dangerously and to program for eventual failure every relationship we enter.” ― Tom Robbins</p>

<p>“Our lives are not as limited as we think they are; the world is a wonderfully weird place; consensual reality is significantly flawed; no institution can be trusted, but love does work; all things are possible; and we all could be happy and fulfilled if we only had the guts to be truly free and the wisdom to shrink our egos and quit taking ourselves so damn seriously.” ― Tom Robbins</p>

<p>“We are our own dragons as well as our own heroes, and we have to rescue ourselves from ourselves.” ― Tom Robbins, Still Life with Woodpecker</p>

<p>“There is no such thing as a weird human being, It&#8217;s just that some people require more understanding than others.” ― Tom Robbins</p>

<p>“The unhappy person resents it when you try to cheer him up, because that means he has to stop dwelling on himself and start paying attention to the universe. Unhappiness is the ultimate form of self-indulgence. When you&#8217;re unhappy, you get to pay a lot of attention to yourself. You get to take yourself oh so very seriously.” ― Tom Robbins, Jitterbug Perfume</p>

<p>“It&#8217;s never too late to have a happy childhood.” ― Tom Robbins, Still Life with Woodpecker</p>

<p>“Curiosity, especially intellectual inquisitiveness, is what separates the truly alive from those who are merely going through the motions.” ― Tom Robbins</p>

<p>“You&#8217;ve heard of people calling in sick. You may have called in sick a few times yourself. But have you ever thought about calling in well?</p>

<p>It&#8217;d go like this: You&#8217;d get the boss on the line and say, &#8220;Listen, I&#8217;ve been sick ever since I started working here, but today I&#8217;m well and I won&#8217;t be in anymore.&#8221; Call in well.” ― Tom Robbins</p>

<p>“You risked your life, but what else have you ever risked? Have you risked disapproval? Have you ever risked economic security? Have you ever risked a belief? I see nothing particularly courageous about risking one&#8217;s life. So you lose it, you go to your hero&#8217;s heaven and everything is milk and honey &#8216;til the end of time. Right? You get your reward and suffer no earthly consequences. That&#8217;s not courage. Real courage is risking something that might force you to rethink your thoughts and suffer change and stretch consciousness. Real courage is risking one&#8217;s clichés.” ― Tom Robbins, Another Roadside Attraction</p></blockquote>

<p>The super ultra point is, I should quit taking myself too seriously and Tom Robbins is pretty damn awesome. I should read more books of his =) Peace!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is a story about the song Hurricane Katrina by Nadeah. The bottom line is that I love the song, but I didn&#8217;t buy the song and I&#8217;m not proud of it.</p>

<p>First I heard the song on <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/roots/playlist/default.htm">Triple J</a> How did I learn about such an awesome Australian radio station? That&#8217;s another story goes back to <a href="http://railscamps.com/">Rails Camp</a>@<a href="http://goo.gl/maps/NoYP">Springbrook</a> and a nice gentlemen who goes by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/MarkRatjens">@MarkRatjens</a> on Twitter =)</p>

<p>The song instantly got to me. My first reaction was to go on youtube trying to search for it. There was a couple live versions. I was of course dissatisfied. So next up vimeo.com yet no studio version. But the silver lining is that I found another cute and apparently more famous song of Nadeah&#8217;s : Odile</p>

<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/31532711" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>


<p>So after playing Odile for a couple times I decided the album &#8220;Venus Gets Even&#8221; which both songs are from is what I want.</p>

<p>ME WANTZ:
<img src="/images/post/2012-07-02-venus-gets-even.jpg" title="[venus gets even]" ></p>

<p>So being a responsible good citizen as I am, I went to iTunes Store. Searched and got: <em>Your search had no results.</em> Hmmm fine. Googled and got to Nadeah&#8217;s official site. Sweet, I can &#8216;buy online&#8217; or &#8216;by on iTunes&#8217;. Let&#8217;s try iTunes again, since it would not require shipping of any sort. There I was, iTunes Store France&#8230; Never mind, I still know where the buy button is. So I clicked and got: <em>This Apple ID is only valid for purchases in the U.S. iTunes Store. You will be switched to that Store. Try your purchase again.</em> And redirected to iTunes Store home page I was. Back to square one. Fine I&#8217;ll have it shipped. So I filled in my shipping details, was redirected to paypal, logged in and bam! something like <em>The merchant does not ship to your country.</em> And redirected I was back on Nadeah&#8217;s homepage. Why does nobody want to take my money?!</p>

<p><img src='/images/post/2012-07-02-rage-face.png' title='rageface' class='plain'/></p>

<p>That&#8217;s it, torrent time. There we go: 0 seed and 0 leech. You know how it works - the more you can&#8217;t have it, the more you desire it. So the only decent version I have is from streaming from Triple J. If only I could record it&#8230;</p>

<p>Googling mac audio recorder gives me <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">Audacity</a>. Following the <a href="http://manual.audacityteam.org/help/manual/man/tutorial_recording_computer_playback_on_mac.html">tutorial</a> I had my audio output redirect to <a href="http://cycling74.com/soundflower-landing-page/">soundflower</a> and simply by playing the time range of the streaming on Triple J the song was recorded. With a bit of cleaning up like some cropping and fading out the last bit. Here is what I got:</p>

<p><audio controls="controls">
  <source src="/media/Hurricane_Katrina.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />
  Awww too bad your browser does not support the audio tag.
</audio></p>

<p>Enjoy. I guess that&#8217;s what they call a guilty pleasure.</p>

<p>*disclaimer: I do not own the song. The song is not for distribution. It&#8217;s only for sharing because it is beautiful.</p>

<p>Gone are the days when you thought you&#8217;ve sent out an important piece of document to someone and only discovered an hour later that you forgot to attache the file. *facepalm* Now gmail searches for word like &#8220;is attached&#8221; in your email content, and alerts you when you hit the send button if there&#8217;s no attachment to the email. That&#8217;s a nice little big detail there. Thanks gmail =)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It started with this talk by Joshua Foer on how one can use techniques like <em>the memory palace</em> to cultivate his/her memory to prepare speeches, remember random numbers and in his case, won a memory competition. I like his final remark about how the convenience provided by technology trained us to be too lazy to remember. But life is short and we are the sum of our memories. We need to be the kind of person who remembers to remember.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a great talk. Having a cultivated memory is not only important but also pretty handy. As sad and visually unpleasant the original memory palace story is, the technique actually sounded pretty fun. So I was reading about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transit_of_Venus," title="transit of Venus">transit of Venus</a>. Here is a little application:</p>

<blockquote><p>In forever 21, a 5-year-old boy is holding a full mark paper(100/100), while his young beautiful mother (who&#8217;s wearing a pair of very big glasses) reluctantly walks away from a big big round mirror to the fitting room.</p></blockquote>

<p>That translate to:</p>

<blockquote><p>Transits of Venus occur in a pattern that repeats every 243 years, with pairs of transits eight years apart separated by long gaps of 121.5 years and 105.5 years.</p></blockquote>

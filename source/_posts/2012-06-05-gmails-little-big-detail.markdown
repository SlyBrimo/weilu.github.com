Gone are the days when you thought you've sent out an important piece of document to someone and only discovered an hour later that you forgot to attache the file. \*facepalm\* Now gmail searches for word like "is attached" in your email content, and alerts you when you hit the send button if there's no attachment to the email. That's a nice little big detail there. Thanks gmail =)

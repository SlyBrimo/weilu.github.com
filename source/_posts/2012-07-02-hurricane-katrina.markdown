This is a story about the song Hurricane Katrina by Nadeah. The bottom line is that I love the song, but I didn't buy the song and I'm not proud of it.

First I heard the song on [Triple J](http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/roots/playlist/default.htm) How did I learn about such an awesome Australian radio station? That's another story goes back to [Rails Camp](http://railscamps.com/)@[Springbrook](http://goo.gl/maps/NoYP) and a nice gentlemen who goes by [@MarkRatjens](https://twitter.com/#!/MarkRatjens) on Twitter =)

The song instantly got to me. My first reaction was to go on youtube trying to search for it. There was a couple live versions. I was of course dissatisfied. So next up vimeo.com yet no studio version. But the silver lining is that I found another cute and apparently more famous song of Nadeah's : Odile

So after playing Odile for a couple times I decided the album "Venus Gets Even" which both songs are from is what I want.

ME WANTZ:

So being a responsible good citizen as I am, I went to iTunes Store. Searched and got: *Your search had no results.* Hmmm fine. Googled and got to Nadeah's official site. Sweet, I can 'buy online' or 'by on iTunes'. Let's try iTunes again, since it would not require shipping of any sort. There I was, iTunes Store France... Never mind, I still know where the buy button is. So I clicked and got: *This Apple ID is only valid for purchases in the U.S. iTunes Store. You will be switched to that Store. Try your purchase again.* And redirected to iTunes Store home page I was. Back to square one. Fine I'll have it shipped. So I filled in my shipping details, was redirected to paypal, logged in and bam! something like *The merchant does not ship to your country.* And redirected I was back on Nadeah's homepage. Why does nobody want to take my money?!

That's it, torrent time. There we go: 0 seed and 0 leech. You know how it works - the more you can't have it, the more you desire it. So the only decent version I have is from streaming from Triple J. If only I could record it...

Googling mac audio recorder gives me [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/). Following the [tutorial](http://manual.audacityteam.org/help/manual/man/tutorial_recording_computer_playback_on_mac.html) I had my audio output redirect to [soundflower](http://cycling74.com/soundflower-landing-page/) and simply by playing the time range of the streaming on Triple J the song was recorded. With a bit of cleaning up like some cropping and fading out the last bit. Here is what I got:

<audio controls="controls">
  <source src="/media/Hurricane_Katrina.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />
  Awww too bad your browser does not support the audio tag.
</audio>

Enjoy. I guess that's what they call a guilty pleasure.

*disclaimer: I do not own the song. The song is not for distribution. It's only for sharing because it is beautiful.
